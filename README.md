In this project, I will be going to build a basic recipe website with all the HTML knowledge i have acquired. 
The website will consist of main index page which will have links to a few recipes. 

# Recipe Website

A simple recipe website built with HTML.  

## Structure
- `index.html` — Home page
- `recipes/` — Individual recipe pages  
  - `chicken-tikka.html`
  - `choc-cookie.html`
  - `shrimp-fried-rice.html`
- `img/` — Images for recipes

## Purpose
This project is for practicing HTML and Git by building a small, static recipe site.

## Note
Still new to Git, so my commit history is part of the learning journey.
